## Assignment #1 | Group 4
Alanna Wittet, Jack Halverson, Wladka Kijewska, Yuanzhao Wang

This set of maps compares open space and park lights in Cambridge, MA. The 5 maps vary in efficacy, with one notably ineffective example and one very compelling example.

```{r load packages, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(ggspatial)
library(ggthemes)
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
parklights <- st_read("INFRA_ParkLights.gdb")
openspace <- st_read("RECREATION_OpenSpace.shp")
```

## Map #1
This clean map clearly shows areas of open space in Cambridge and the concentration of park lights within those open spaces. The opacity of the open space reveals water underneath, so those are areas where park lights should not be expected. However, it does reveal the small set of open spaces that do not have park lights, leading to unpleasant or unsafe experiences.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot() +
  annotation_map_tile(zoomin = 0, progress = "none", type = "cartolight") +
  geom_sf(data = openspace,
          color = NA,
          alpha = 0.25,
          aes(fill = "Open Space")) +
    geom_sf(data = parklights,
          size = 0.75,      
          shape = 19,
          alpha = 1,
          aes(color = "Park Light")) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = "dark green", name = " ") +
  scale_color_manual(values = "gold", name = "") +
  labs(caption = "Map tiles and data by OpenStreetMap") +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
        legend.key = element_rect(fill = "white"))+
  theme_map() 

```

## This is another test


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
